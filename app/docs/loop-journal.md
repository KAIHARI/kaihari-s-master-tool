# Loop journal

A running record of an autonomous improvement pass on `app/`, working towards a deck
builder that feels like arranging real cards on a table rather than editing a list.

Each entry says what changed, why, and how it was verified. Newest last.

## Why this file exists

`androidx.*` is served only from Google's Maven, which is unreachable from the environment
this work is being done in. `:core` compiles and its tests run locally; `:ui`,
`:desktopApp` and `:androidApp` do not compile at all. **CI is the only compiler that ever
sees Compose code here.**

Two working rules follow from that, and they are the reason the commits are shaped the way
they are:

1. **Arithmetic lives in `:core`.** Foil angles, selection ranges, autoscroll curves, grid
   geometry — anything that can be a number is a tested pure function, so the Compose layer
   only ever binds values that are already known to be right.
2. **Push small and often, and never start the next thing while CI is red.** A large
   never-compiled Compose diff is the failure mode all of this exists to avoid.

## Verifying locally

```bash
cd app
./gradlew :core:jvmTest -Pmastertool.android=false
```

## 0. Baseline

`:core:jvmTest` green — 249 tests across 19 classes. Working from
`claude/deck-builder-autonomous-loop-demcdc` at `8448e92`.

Confirmed by probe, not assumption:

| Host | Result |
|---|---|
| `repo.maven.apache.org`, `plugins.gradle.org` | reachable |
| `dl.google.com` | 403 at the proxy — and `androidx.*` is not mirrored on Maven Central |
| `db.ygoprodeck.com` | 403 — no live card data, so tests use `TestCards.kt` fixtures |
